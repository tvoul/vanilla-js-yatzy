# Yahtzee!

Dice game written in Vanilla JavaScript, using Node.js/express backend.

```
  npm install
  npm start
```


Roll the dice and click the ones you wish to keep. Clicked dice will move to "keep" area and you can also click them back to the "roll" area.
After 3 rolls the button is disabled and you need to choose your scoring option.

Rules:

In my home country, One pair and Two pair is also an option, so that was added :)
